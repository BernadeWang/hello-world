# hello-world
First ever github repository

It is actually the first day, or to be exact, the second day of me starting working. I notice, well, to be frank, have noticed once more how lame I am, with nothing familiar with and good at. I cannot say it is an oppotunity for me to learn and grow, so I will learn harder than ever to accomplish what I have left out, and overcome the weakness of my personality to become more cooperative, more frank, and more extroverted.
